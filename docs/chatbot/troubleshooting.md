# Troubleshooting

This section aims to help you quickly resolve common issues you might encounter with the StreamElements Chatbot and answer frequently asked questions.

## Troubleshooting

### Chatbot Not Responding

- **Check if the bot is currently active in your channel.** You can do this by going to your StreamElements dashboard and ensuring the bot is turned on.
- **Ensure the bot is not banned or ignored in your channel.** Sometimes, the bot might have been accidentally banned, which would prevent it from posting messages.

### Commands Not Working

- **Verify the command syntax.** Ensure that the command is typed correctly, including the prefix (usually `!`).
- **Check command settings.** Some commands may be set to work only for moderators or the streamer. You can adjust these settings in your StreamElements dashboard.
- **Command cooldown.** If a command was recently used, it might be on cooldown. Check the command's settings to see if there's a cooldown period set.

### Timers Not Triggering

- **Check the timer settings.** Ensure the timers are enabled and configured with the correct intervals and chat lines required to trigger.
- **Insufficient chat activity.** Some timers require a minimum amount of chat activity to trigger. Encourage your viewers to be more active in chat.
