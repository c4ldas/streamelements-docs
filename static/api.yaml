    ## About this document

    This is the unofficial StreamElements REST API documentation. 
    Here you will find an updated list of StreamElements endpoints that are not available on the official [developer website](https://dev.streamelements.com) or [docs](https://docs.streamelements.com) page.

    For some time, I have been collecting and documenting as many endpoints as I could from [https://api.streamelements.com/kappa/](https://api.streamelements.com/kappa/) and putting them together in a way I could understand and use it.

    This page is a result of that, where I now have the endpoints added, with body and response examples and query parameters fixed. 

    Also, there are some endpoints/operations that don't work, and they were moved to `wonky - not working` group folder. 
    As the name suggests, these are endpoints that don't work as expected or lack enough information to use them properly.

    Not a single endpoint/operation was removed from the official documentation. This page contains all same ones from the official documentation (and more), but with examples and explanations.

    Every operation now includes response examples and, where needed, body examples with some explanations to make things clearer.

    ## Repository

    This documentation is available on my Github repository ([https://github.com/c4ldas/streamelements-api](https://github.com/c4ldas/streamelements-api)) and it is open (and appreciated) for suggestions.

    So if you spot any error, missing info, wrong info or even any odd word or sentence, feel free to contact me or open an issue on Github page.

    ## How to use it

    In order to use StreamElements API, you just need to have an StreamElements account linking your Twitch / Youtube / Trovo / Twitter account.

    With your SE account created, you can make requests just using the below:

    - Channel id

    - Token

    You can understand what they are in the next topics

    ### Channel Id

    Channel Id is also known as Account Id and it is a code that represents your channel / profile. That info is public and safe to share.

    You can obtain your channel Id in your StreamElements dashboard using this link: [https://streamelements.com/dashboard/account/channels](https://streamelements.com/dashboard/account/channels)

    ### Token

    Token is a private code and should not be shared not put in a front end application. That token should be kept secret, treat them like your password.

    Tokens are used for authorization / authentication for certain requests. 

    This API documentation uses 3 types of token. 
    - JWT
    - Overlay Token
    - oAuth2

    In the next topics you will have more information on how to obtain those tokens.

    Note: Not all operations accept all types of token. Most of them accept JWT, some use Oauth2 and a few will support Overlay Token. 
    When trying to use a non-supported type of authentication, you will receive a `403 - Forbidden` message.

    You can see on each operation which types they support.    

    ### - JWT 

    It is the bearer token, most endpoints use this one and it is focused on personal projects. 

    Use it with `bearer` prefix in the Authorization header.

    Example: `Authorization: bearer TOKEN`

    You can find your JWT in https://streamelements.com/dashboard/account/channels

    ### - Overlay Token 

    This is the token you can mostly use with endpoints related to overlays and custom widgets. 

    Use it with `apikey` prefix in the Authorization header

    Example: `Authorization: apikey TOKEN`

    You can find your Overlay token in https://streamelements.com/dashboard/account/channels

    You can also find it in a custom widget when using `onWidgetLoad` event listener.

    ```js
    window.addEventListener("onWidgetLoad", (obj) => {
      const token = obj.detail.channel.apiToken;
      console.log("Overlay token:", token);
    })
    ```

    ### - oAuth2 Token 

    It is the oAuth token you can use it after receiving a Client ID and Client Secret. 

    Use it with `oAuth` or `oauth2` prefix in the Authorization header.

    Example: `Authorization: oauth2 TOKEN`

    You can request oAuth access using the form in https://strms.net/oauth2_request

    ## Improvements

    If you spot any errors or think something could be improved, please let me know!
    Also, if an endpoint doesn't make sense or isn't clear enough, that's a sign it needs more explanation — don't hesitate to reach out with your questions on Github repository.

    Good luck and happy coding!

          Each `type` requires different `data` object. Here are some examples:

          ## Twitch
          ### - follow
          ```json
          {
            "type": "follow",  
            "provider": "twitch",
            "data": {
              "providerId": "1234567", // optional, but make sure to use the actual Twitch user ID
              "username": "MrSim",
              "avatar": "https://link/to/image.png" // optional
            }
          }
          ```

          ### - subscriber
          ```json
          {
            "type": "subscriber",
            "provider": "twitch",
            "activityGroup":"9876543219876", // community gifts only
            "data": {
              "amount": 1,
              "message": "This is a message", // resubs only
              "username": "MrSim", // either subscriber or gifted user
              "sender": "MrGifter", // subgifts and community gifts only
              "gifted": true, // subgifts only
              "bulkGifted": true, // community gifts only (not sure, I don't use it and it works fine)
              "avatar": "https://link/to/image.png" // optional
            }
          }
          ``` 

          ### - communityGift
          _This event has an "activityGroup" key that you will need to add to the gifted subscribers. The actual value is irrelevant as long as you use the same for the gifted one._

          _The "amount" value represents how many gifts were given, and you will need to send the same amount of subscriber alerts with same "activityGroup" value._

            "provider": "twitch",
            "data": {
              "amount": 3, // That means 3 gifted subscriber events will need to be sent afterwards
              "username": "mrsim",

        Bug Notes: 
        ```
        Issue: 
        /:channel/banphrases does not save to correct channel

        Description: 
        The POST operation for https://api.streamelements.com/kappa/v2/bot/filters/{channel}/banphrases doesn't save to the channel ID used on the path. Instead, it saves on the account ID the JWT was created.

        If you copy your JWT and paste it on https://jwt.io, you will see a key called "channel" in the payload. That is the channel ID the banphrase will be saved to.

        The impact is that in case you have many channels to moderate, you cannot use your own JWT to create banphrases for all of them.

        oAuth credentials don't have this issue, as the access_token only gives access to a single channel. Trying to use a different channel from what the access_token is allowed to, triggers 403 error (as expected).

        This issue was reported to StreamElements team on 22/Aug/2024, but it hasn't been fixed yet.
