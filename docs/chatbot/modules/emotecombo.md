# Emote Combo Module

## Overview

The Emote Combo feature is an interactive chat module that encourages viewers to create chains of consecutive emotes. It adds a fun, engaging element to your stream by challenging viewers to maintain and extend emote streaks.

## Usage

The Emote Combo feature activates automatically when viewers start sending consecutive emotes in chat. Here's how it works:

1. A viewer initiates the combo by sending a message containing a single emote.
2. Subsequent messages must contain only the same emote to continue the combo.
3. The combo count increases with each consecutive matching emote.
4. The combo ends when a different emote or any other message is sent.
