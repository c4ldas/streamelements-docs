# 8ball Module

## Overview

The 8ball module is an interactive chat feature that simulates the classic Magic 8 Ball toy. It allows viewers to ask questions and receive random, customizable responses, enhancing engagement and entertainment in your Twitch chat.

## Usage

To use the 8ball module, viewers type `!8ball` followed by their question in the chat. The chatbot will then respond with a random answer from a predefined list.

**Syntax:** `!8ball <question>`

## Examples

1. Viewer: `!8ball Will I win my next game?`
   Chatbot: `The 8ball says: It is certain.`

2. Viewer: `!8ball Should I order pizza tonight?`
   Chatbot: `The 8ball says: Ask again later.`

## Parameters

The 8ball command does not have any additional parameters. The question asked by the viewer is optional and does not affect the randomized response.
