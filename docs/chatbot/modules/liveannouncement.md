# Live Announcement Module

## Overview

The Live Announcement module is a feature of the StreamElements Chatbot that automatically posts a message in the chat when a stream goes live. This helps notify viewers that the stream has started and provides essential information about the stream.

## Usage

When enabled, the Live Announcement module works automatically without any manual input required. As soon as the stream goes live, the chatbot will post a predefined message in the chat.

## Examples

1. Default announcement:
```
ExampleStreamer is now live! Streaming Fortnite: Late night squad games with friends!
```

2. Custom announcement:
```
ðŸŽ‰ ExampleStreamer just went live! They're playing Minecraft and the stream title is "Building a mega castle - Day 3". Don't miss out!
```

## Parameters

The Live Announcement message can include the following parameters:

- `${channel.display_name}`: The display name of the channel
- `{title}`: The title of the live stream
- `{game}`: The game or category being streamed

## Configuration

To configure the Live Announcement module:

1. Go to your StreamElements dashboard
2. Navigate to the Chatbot settings

5. Customize the announcement message using the available parameters
